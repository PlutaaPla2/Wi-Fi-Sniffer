# Claude Log

## Main Objective

Track changes Claude makes to the Wi-Fi Sniffer project, in the same style as `TASK_LOG.md`. but always record a time of writing in 24-hour format also.

## 2026-07-14 Print all frame types in real-time terminal log

- Changed `handle_packet()` in `src/night_sniffer_v3.py` so every tracked frame type is printed to the live terminal, not only client frames.
- Previously the terminal print was gated on `if pkt_type in CLIENT_FRAME_TYPES`, so beacons (and any AP-side frame) were written to `wifi_full_recon_report.csv` but never shown live. This is why beacons "could not be detected" in the console even with APs nearby.
- New behavior:
  - Removed the `CLIENT_FRAME_TYPES` gate around the `print(...)` call so it always runs for any frame `classify_frame()` recognizes.
  - Added a `frame_tag` prefix so the line still shows what kind of frame it is:
    - `[C]` for client frames (`PROBE`, `ASSOC_REQ`, `REASSOC_REQ`, `AUTH`, `DEAUTH`, `DISASSOC`).
    - `[A]` for AP/other management frames (`BEACON` today, plus anything new).
  - This is future-proof: any new frame type added to `classify_frame()` later will print automatically without touching this block again.
- Kept the CSV logging unchanged. Frames were already written to the CSV for all types; only the terminal visibility changed.
- Related finding (not caused by this session): beacons often appear missing because channel hopping is opt-in. Commit `29fb075` made hopping require the `--hop` flag (default off), so without `--hop` the radio stays on one channel and misses APs beaconing on other channels. Run `sudo python3 src/night_sniffer_v3.py --hop` to sweep channels 1-13.
- Verification run:
  - `python3 -m py_compile src/night_sniffer_v3.py` passed.
  - `python3 -m unittest tests.claude_night_sniffer_v3` passed (73 tests).
- Next possible step: if the `[A]` beacon lines are too noisy in busy areas, consider a `--quiet-ap` flag or rate-limiting AP prints, so client activity stays readable.

## 2026-07-14 Add --frames flag to choose which frames the terminal shows

- Followed up on the "next possible step" above: added a CLI flag so beacons can be hidden from the real-time terminal without touching CSV output.
- Added `--frames {all,no-beacon}` to `main()` in `src/night_sniffer_v3.py` (default `all`):
  - `all` — print every tracked frame type (unchanged default behavior).
  - `no-beacon` — print every frame except `BEACON`.
- How it is wired:
  - New module-level global `TERMINAL_FRAME_FILTER = "all"` (near `CLIENT_FRAME_TYPES`). `main()` sets it from `args.frames` via `global TERMINAL_FRAME_FILTER` before capture starts. A global is needed because `handle_packet` is the `sniff()` `prn` callback and cannot take extra arguments.
  - In `handle_packet()` the terminal print is now gated on `show_in_terminal = TERMINAL_FRAME_FILTER == "all" or pkt_type != "BEACON"`. Only the `print(...)` is gated; `_append_csv_row(...)` and `dump_ie_details(...)` still run for every frame.
  - Added a startup log line `Terminal frame filter : <mode>` so the active mode is visible when the tool launches.
- This only affects the terminal real-time log. `wifi_full_recon_report.csv` and `ie_details_report.csv` still receive all frame types, including beacons.
- Usage examples:
  - `sudo python3 src/night_sniffer_v3.py` → shows all frames (default).
  - `sudo python3 src/night_sniffer_v3.py --frames no-beacon` → hides beacons from the terminal only.
  - Combine with hopping: `sudo python3 src/night_sniffer_v3.py --hop --frames no-beacon`.
- Verification run:
  - `python3 -m py_compile src/night_sniffer_v3.py` passed.
  - `python3 -m unittest tests.claude_night_sniffer_v3` passed (77 tests).
  - Manual gating check confirmed: with `all`, BEACON and PROBE both print; with `no-beacon`, BEACON is hidden while PROBE still prints.
- Design note: chose `no-beacon` over a generic per-type filter because the request was specifically all-vs-no-beacon. If more granularity is wanted later, `--frames` could grow to accept a comma-separated allow/deny list without breaking the current two choices.

## 2026-07-14 (written 17:26) Phase 1 — frame-body dispatcher (`parse_frame_body`)

- Implemented Phase 1 from `prompts/phase1_framebody.prompt.md` against `src/night_sniffer_v3.py`. Full handoff detail is in `explanation/20260714_1726_framebody.md`; this is the summary.
- Precondition check: read `explanation/20260714_1120_backbone.md` to confirm Phase 0 (seq → `Seq_Num` column, tag-0-only SSID, `00:50:f2` type-byte fix). Phase 1 builds on that and does not re-extract the sequence number.
- Added to `src/night_sniffer_v3.py`:
  - `parse_frame_body(pkt, pkt_type)` — dispatcher returning subtype fixed fields (listen interval, capability info, current AP, security tier, auth status, reason code, direction); malformed frames are swallowed so the `sniff()` callback never dies.
  - Two pure, unit-tested helpers: `auth_tier(algo, tags)` and `frame_direction(pkt)`.
  - Seven CSV columns appended **after `Seq_Num`** (never inserted): `Listen_Interval, Cap_Info, Current_AP, Security_Tier, Auth_Status, Reason_Code, Direction`. `CSV_FIELDS` is now 25 wide.
  - Store-only `Session` fields `current_aps` / `listen_intervals` / `security_tiers`, filled via `track_session()`→`_update_session()` (new optional args, defaulted). **Not** used in any scoring/merge/veto — that is Phase 2.
  - Wired `parse_frame_body` into `handle_packet()` after `extract_ie_details`.
- Scope kept: no active/transmit techniques; no Phase 2 scoring; no HT/VHT byte parsing (Phase 3); no WPS/taxonomy (Phase 4); Assoc/Reassoc RESPONSE Status/AID deliberately deferred (flagged for senior sync).
- CSV operational note: appended-at-end means pre-Phase-1 rows are narrower than new rows. On a deployed sniffer with an existing report, rotate/rename it once before the first Phase 1 run so `setup_csv()` writes a fresh 25-column header. No live report exists in this tree, so nothing was rotated.
- Verification:
  - `python3 -m py_compile src/night_sniffer_v3.py` and `python3 -m compileall -q src tests` passed.
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*.py'` passed — 96 tests.
  - Helper unit tests added for `auth_tier` (5 cases) and `frame_direction` (4 cases).
  - Updated two Phase 0 tests that assumed `Seq_Num` was the last column (now reference index `-8`); this is a test-expectation fix, not a behavior regression.
  - No linter configured (no ruff/flake8/pyproject/setup.cfg; CI has no lint step), so none was run.
  - Functional drive confirmed ASSOC_REQ/REASSOC_REQ fields populate and land in the store-only Session sets.
- Did not run any git command (prompt: human manages version control). Edited files left in the working tree for review.

## 2026-07-16 (written 11:35) Wrote Phase 0 + Phase 1 explanation (presentation)

- Created `explanation/20260716_1135_phase0_phase1_summary.md` — a documentation-only, presentation-oriented explanation. No source code was changed.
- Checked `git log` to pin the two phases: Phase 0 = `98029c1` "AI is the power"; Phase 1 = `92185c9` "Implemented phase 1". Read both diffs with `git show`.
- Covered, per the request:
  - Baseline capability that existed before both phases (capture loop, `classify_frame`, raw-TLV IE extraction, fingerprinting, distance, session tracking, reporting).
  - Phase 0: added `Seq_Num` capture from `Dot11.SC`, tag-0-only SSID fix, `00:50:f2` WMM/WPS type-byte fix + `NON_DEVICE_VENDOR_IE_OUIS`, and the unused-for-now `seq_delta()` helper.
  - Phase 1: `parse_frame_body()` dispatcher, `auth_tier()`/`frame_direction()` helpers, 7 appended CSV columns, and store-only `Session` fields.
  - Frame types captured: 9 (BEACON, PROBE, ASSOC_RESP/REQ, REASSOC_RESP/REQ, AUTH, DEAUTH, DISASSOC).
  - IEs: 26 named in `IE_NAMES`, subset decoded in `_decode_ie`, fingerprint built in `extract_ie_details`.
  - Inferred device info: vendor, real vs randomized MAC, device class/region, distance/zone, security tier, roaming, OS/driver hints, lifecycle events, presence/dwell.
- Grounded entirely in the current `src/night_sniffer_v3.py` and git history; no active/transmit or scope-widening content introduced.
